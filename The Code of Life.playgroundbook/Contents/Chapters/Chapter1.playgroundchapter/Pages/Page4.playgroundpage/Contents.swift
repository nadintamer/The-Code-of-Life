 ## Nucleotide Pairing
 Your DNA is made up of building blocks called **nucleotides.** You can think of nucleotides as LEGOs that fit together. There are different kinds of nucleotides, just like there are different types of LEGOs! The four types of nucleotides are called **adenine** (A), **guanine** (G), **cytosine** (C), and **thymine** (T).
 
Notice how the DNA above looks a little like a ladder? There are actually two strands of DNA that are held together by "rungs" composed of two nucleotides. But not all nucleotides can bind to each other! There are two rules:
 
 1. An **adenine** is always paired with a **thymine**.
 2. A **guanine** is always paired with a **cytosine**.
 
 This means that there is always an equal number of As and Ts, and an equal number of Gs and Cs in a DNA sequence. It also means that if we know the sequence on one DNA strand, we can write out the sequence on the other strand!
 
 **Your Turn:** Tap each of the buttons next to the nucleotides to reveal the sequence of the other strand of DNA! Tap "Next Page" below when you're ready to move on.
